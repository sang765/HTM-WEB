## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to create a calm and inviting feel, referencing a clear sky or water, aligned with modern, clean design principles.
- Background color: Light off-white (#F5F5F5), a very desaturated version of the primary hue, ensuring content legibility and a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#E59866), analogous to blue, yet different enough in saturation and brightness to draw the eye.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for headlines and shorter text, giving a precise and fashionable look.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, a neutral, objective appearance appropriate for blocks of text.
- Use Material Design icons to maintain consistency with the overall Material Design 3 style.
- Employ a clean and spacious layout, following Material Design 3 guidelines for spacing and visual hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as gentle fades or transitions, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
